# To empty the local storage
//localStorage.removeItem('cart')
//did this since we were adding the deliveryOptiionId

#sometimes if you face any errors there can be reason that any bad data is saved inside the localStorage,so we can use the following:
//localStorage.clear()
//after that referesh the page
//localStorage.getItem()//to get the item in localStorage
