Backend = another computer that manages the data of a website 
//How does our computer send information to the backend ?
HTTP = HyperText Transfer Protocol
HTTP message is sent through internet from frontend interaction to backend

A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.

Promises - better way to handle asynchronous code  
//resolve is similar to done() function//let us wait for some code to finish befoer going to the next step 

fetch() = a better way to make request 
feth uses a promise

async await = even better way to handle asynchronous code 
//problem with promises is that it creates xtra code 
//the reason we use async , because it lets us use await
//await = let us wait for a promise to finish before going to next line
//async await shortcut for promises, so it recommended

//Error Handling 
when we are sending HTTP requests, we could get unexpected errors

//try catch can be used with synchronous code or normal code, it is not necessary to be a async await
//try skip the code and go to catch

//why dont we use try catch everywhere ?
its meant to handle unexpected errors (code is correct , error is outside our control)

//throw - manual error

4types of requests
GET - get something from backend
POST - create something
PUT = update something
DELETE = delete something
