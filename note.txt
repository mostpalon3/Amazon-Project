Disadvantage of Manual Testing
1.Hard to test every situation and takes to much time
2.Hard to re-test

So we ,use Automated test
using code to test the code 

//let say we change the code , in manual testing we would have to open the website and setup everything manually , but in automated code we just need to re-run these test code 
//situation = test case
//1.Basic test cases = if code is working or not
//2.Edge cases = test with the values which are tricky

//group of related tests = test suite 
1.Create test suite 
2.create tests 
3.Compare values and display result 


//Testing Framework = external library that helps us write tests easier 

In this project we are using testing framework JASMINE
MOst testing frameworks are similar 
Othere testing frameworks:
jest(for ReactJS)
MochaJS

spec= test

Test Coverage = how much of the code is being tested (try to maximize the test coverage)
flaky test = test that sometimes passes and sometimes fails 

// unit test = test 1 code 
//integration test = tests many units /pieces of coded together
1.How the page looks 
2.How the page behaves 


//shortcut in jasmine 
//Hooks =lets us run some code for each test

//Hooks in jasmine :
//beforeEach() - runs code before each test
//afterEach() - runs code after each test
//beforeAll() - runs code before all test
//afterAll() - runs code after all test

process
1.Mkae changes to code2.Re-run the tests 
3.Save to Git


URL parameters
we need to make each tracking page different , so we will use  url parameters
after the URL type:
(left side)?orderId=123&productId=456 //property value pair, right side- value
this is sort of like object {
    objectId:123
}
eg.trackinghtml
